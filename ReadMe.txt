1. Create a database (for example, demodb) at phpMyAdmin and import the "SQL/users.sql" file into this database.

2. Open the "config.php" file in a editor: 
===> Specify the database host (DB_HOST), username (DB_USERNAME), password (DB_PASSWORD), and name (DB_NAME) as per your MySQL database credentials.
===> Specify the Facebook App ID (FB_APP_ID), Facebook App Secret (FB_APP_SECRET), and Callback URL (FB_REDIRECT_URL) as per your Facebook App credentials.
